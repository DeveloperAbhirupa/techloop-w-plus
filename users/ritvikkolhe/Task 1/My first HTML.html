		<h2>Ritvik Kolhe's life</h2>
		<p>Im from <b>Mumbai</b>... Even though Im from <b>Thane</b>, I would still say Im from Mumbai because it sounds cooler.<br>
		I was born in <b>Chandigarh</b>.... People ask me, How am i from Mumbai then?<br>
		My family currently lives in <b>Agra</b>.<br>
		I did my schooling in 5-6 different states... I know it's crazy right?<br>
		One of my biggest problem is when someone asks me for my <b>Permanent address</b>.<br>
		It must all have sounded weird unless your parents have a <b>Transferable job</b>.<br>
		Everyone like me sums up the above points by saying they are a <b>Defence Brat</b>.</p>
